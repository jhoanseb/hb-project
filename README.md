Hello!

I share with you my solution to the problem.

To run it you have to run both projects, the backend and the frontend at the same time.

`npm run dev`

In addition, you have to add the `.env` file with the `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and the `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` from the github oauth for full operation.

I hope my solution is clear, but I remain attentive to any concerns.

Regards!
